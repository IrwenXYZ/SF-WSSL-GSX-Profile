Like my work? Support me at https://ko-fi.com/irwenxyz

## What this profile includes
- Custom named gates
- Accurate wingspan for all gates
- Proper parking positions (Full list of aircraft below!)
- Marshaller positions
- Proper pushback procedures as per Seletar AIP

### Parking Positions
This profile includes proper parking positions for the following aircraft types
- ATR72
- E170
- E175
- E190
- E195
- A320 (A318-A321)
- B737 (900-900)

While 757s and C130s fly to Seletar, I don't have access to them in MSFS, therefore they will use the default position.

NOTE: For Embraer aircrafts to work, the aircraft GSX profile MUST be populated with their respective ICAO codes (E170, E175, E190, or E195)

## Installation
1. Ensure Microsoft Flight Simulator and GSX Pro are closed
2. Copy the downloaded files: `WSSL-SF-IrwenXYZ.ini` **AND** `WSSL-SF-IrwenXYZ.py`
3. Paste it in the GSX Config directory, typically `C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\virtuali\GSX\MSFS`

## IMPORTANT NOTES
2. Please enable "Automated reposition" in GSX settings.
3. Not all pushback procedures might be true to life. If you have any reference for procedures that can be improved to be more real to life, please open an issue on Github (https://github.com/IrwenXYZ/SF-WSSL-GSX-Profile).
